## 📌 Project Description
This project uses the famous Iris dataset to build a classification model. We explore the data using correlation matrix and heatmaps, train the model using logistic regression (or other classifiers), and evaluate its performance.

## 📁 Dataset
The Iris dataset contains:
- 150 samples
- 4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
- 3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Pair plots to visualize feature distributions
- Correlation matrix and heatmap
- Checking for missing values and class distribution

## 🧠 Model Building
- Split dataset into train and test sets
- Train Logistic Regression (or other models like SVM, Decision Tree)
- Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
- Plot confusion matrix

## 📈 Visualization
- Heatmaps
- Pairplots
- Confusion matrix plot
- Accuracy vs model comparison (if multiple models are tested)

## ✅ Results
- Model accuracy: ~95% (depending on classifier)
- Best performance with: *[e.g., Logistic Regression / SVM]*

## 🧪 Future Improvements
- Try other classifiers (Random Forest, KNN)
- Use hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy the model as a web app

## 💻 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Almass1234/iris-classify2.git
